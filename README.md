# ðŸš€ Syngas Production as an Alternative Renewable Energy Source
## **A Case Study for Bolu Province Based on Biomass (Small Cattle Manure)**

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**
This project explores the **potential of syngas production** from biomass as an alternative renewable energy source. The case study focuses on **Bolu Province**, analyzing small cattle manure for **market viability, pipeline infrastructure, heat exchanger design, and reactor optimization**.

## ðŸ“‚ **Project Structure**
### **Part I: Market Survey**
**WP1:** Investigate TÃ¼rkiye's biomass potential, conducting a literature review on manure-based energy sources.  
**WP2:** Analyze elemental composition of manure, compare findings with shift reactions, and perform material balance calculations to determine the inlet stream to the reactor.

### **Part II: Pipeline Design**
**WP1:** Design pipelines and necessary equipment for raw material transfer to the heat exchanger and reactor.
**WP2:** Analyze flow characteristics, pump selection, and hydraulic considerations for optimal pipeline performance.

### **Part III: Heat Exchanger Design**
**WP1:** Identify suitable heat exchanger types and their operational characteristics.
**WP2:** Design a **shell-and-tube heat exchanger**, estimate parameters, and perform cost analysis.
**WP3:** Determine appropriate coolant selection and assess feasibility of **coolant recycling or natural supply sources**.

### **Part IV: Reactor Design**
**WP1:** Evaluate reactor options such as **CSTR, PFR, FBR**, etc.
**WP2:** Determine optimal operating conditions for shift reactions and perform outlet stream calculations.
**WP3:** Define design assumptions, considering **steady and unsteady state conditions**.

### **Part V: Final Report & Cost Analysis**
**WP1:** Perform **overall cost estimation**, including:
- **Initial capital investment**
- **Depreciation analysis**
- **Integrated interest calculations**
- **Economic feasibility assessment**
